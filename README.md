I just made this VS Code extension for fun. It’s not perfect, but it works.
You can highlight parts of your code, give them names and colors, and they’ll stay saved even when you close VS Code.
It also shows all your highlights in a sidebar so you can jump around quickly.

What It Does

Add Highlights: Right-click selected text and give it a name and color

Auto Save: Highlights stay even after restarting VS Code

Sidebar Panel: See all your highlights for the current file in one place

Quick Jump: Click a highlight in the sidebar to jump to it

Any Color You Want: Use hex codes or named colors like “yellow” or “aqua”

How To Use
Add a Highlight

Select some text in your file

Right-click and choose Add Highlight

Give it a name and pick a color (like #FF5733 or yellow)

The highlight appears in your editor

Manage Highlights

Click one to jump right to it
To clear highlights:
Right-click and select “Remove All Highlights in Current File”

Extension Settings
No setup needed. Highlights save automatically to VS Code’s global storage.
If you’re working in a shared folder, they’ll sync across users in the same workspace.

Known Issues
Highlights are tied to file paths, so if you move a file they won’t follow yet
You can’t remove individual highlights yet
If you change line numbers a lot, highlights may shift
